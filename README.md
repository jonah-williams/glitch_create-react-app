# glitch_create-react-redux-app

A template for building React & Redux apps from Glitch.

I wanted to experiment with development on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) using React & Redux. There were some examples of that stack on Glitch (e.g. https://glitch.com/~react-with-redux) but they all included a node server. I wanted to avoid the overhead of running a server and babel or webpack and just focus on frontend JS frameworks.

I found that there was an existing [React only template](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/create-react-app-sample) from [@garethx](https://glitch.com/@garethx) which was a great start. I updated that to use React 16.3.2 and react-scripts 1.1.4, added Redux, built out the basic file structure I'd expect from a Redux app, and added some example tests of the various pieces to allow me to test drive changes.

See the [glitch](https://github.com/jonah-williams/glitch_create-react-redux-app/tree/glitch) branch here or [try it out on Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/glitch-create-react-redux-app)
