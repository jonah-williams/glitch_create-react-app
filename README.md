This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and then updated to use [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) to manage application state.

## Remixing in Glitch

To make the auto-reload feature work, edit the `proxy` option in `package.json` to point to your Glitch app.

## Working with Redux

See the [redux.js.org](https://redux.js.org) and [usage-with-react](https://redux.js.org/basics/usage-with-react) docs.

## Building a React App with create-react-app

See the [create-react-app readme](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/next/README.md)

Note: the introduction of Redux here has changed the file structure somewhat compared to what is referenced in those docs.

## Running tests

Run `npm test` in the Glitch console to start a test watcher.
